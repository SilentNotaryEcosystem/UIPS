  Title: Drop Outdated Transactions from MemPool
  Author: Alexander Andreev
</pre>


== Abstract ==

Outdated Transaction should get removed from the MemPool

== Motivation ==

Unsend transaction might fill the MemPool to a level where the MemPool might allocate a large amount of storage. 
To avoid this situation the MemPool should get checked for unsend transactions.

== Task ==

All transactions are placed in mempool.
If a transaction is local (originated from current node, but not received from other) it should be kept and periodically tried to resend(1h). 
If transaction is to be received from other, a timestamp should be added and removed  after some time. (24h)

== Status == 

Implemented
