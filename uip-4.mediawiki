  Title: Check whether RPC transaction execution can interfere with block execution
  Author: Alexander Andreev
</pre>


== Abstract ==

Check whether RPC transaction execution can interfere with block execution

== Motivation ==

An incoming transaction might have sideeffects with the VM environment. This needs to be analyze and potentially fixed to increase node stability

== Task ==

The VM environment is carefully set up for every transaction execution, but there is the  possibility that it could be interrupted by incoming RPC transaction with another contract call. 

In this case execution results are unpredictable and will lead to node failure.

We should check (write inegrational test?) whether it possible? if yes - fix it using mutex (see code for mutex usage)

== Type ==

BugFix

== Status == 

Open
