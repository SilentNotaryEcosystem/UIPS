</pre>


== Abstract ==

Must work at least not worse than now

== Motivation ==

To increase performance if possible

== Task ==

 - Should be able to use nodes behind NAT/Docker (support TRUST_ANNOUNCE option)
 - Should be able to "forget" old nodes (We can't connect these nodes) like here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#addr
 - Shold NOT forget all the nodes and break the network
 - Peers should send each other only address and capabilities (no counters or local data)

== Status == 

Open
