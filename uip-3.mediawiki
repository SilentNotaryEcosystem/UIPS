== Abstract ==

Cleanup MemPool from transactions that are already added to blocks

== Motivation ==

The MemPool is the tempopary storage for the transactions that are going to get processed.
After processing the MemPool transactions and adding them to blocks the MemPool should get checked for possible transactions to get removed.

== Task ==

This is a follow up on UIP1. 

It happens because every new transaction checks for conflicts with other transactions in MemPool. But it should be checked against patch that is a result of all mempools transaction execution.

== Type ==

BugFix

== Status == 

Implemented
