  Title: Node or running RPC reduces performance upon receiving transactions
  Author: Alexander Andreev

== Abstract ==

Node or running RPC reduces performance upon receiving transactions

== Motivation ==

A node or a running RPC looses performance during uptime when it receives transactions.
This affect reduces the performance of the overall network.

== Task ==

Steps to reproduce: send 10-15 transactions one by one to RPC and the processing time for each transaction will go up. This behaviour needs to get fixed.

It happens because every new transaction checks for conflicts with other transactions in MemPool. But it should be checked against patch that is a result of all mempools transaction execution.

== Type ==

BugFix

== Status == 

Implemented
