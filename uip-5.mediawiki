== Abstract ==

The reason of protobuf exception must be located and fixed


== Motivation ==

After moving to Node.js v. 16.17.0 we could meet this exception in the log:

msgassembler:serializer:error [ 165 ] RangeError: index out of range: 1 + 10 > 1
    at indexOutOfRange (/home/maxim/_projects/Ubikiri/Cil-core/node_modules/protobufjs/src/reader.js:13:12)
    at BufferReader.read_uint32 [as uint32] (/home/maxim/_projects/Ubikiri/Cil-core/node_modules/protobufjs/src/reader.js:98:19)
    at BufferReader.read_int32 [as int32] (/home/maxim/_projects/Ubikiri/Cil-core/node_modules/protobufjs/src/reader.js:109:17)
    at Function.readMsgLength (/home/maxim/_projects/Ubikiri/Cil-core/network/serializer.js:37:40)

== Task ==
